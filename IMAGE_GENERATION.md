# Image Generation Safety and Best Practices

## Overview

The image generation feature uses OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model to create images from text descriptions. To ensure compliance with OpenAI's content policy and provide a better user experience, we've implemented several safety measures.

## Safety Features

### 1. Prompt Validation
- **Content Filtering**: Automatically detects and blocks potentially problematic terms
- **Length Validation**: Ensures prompts are detailed enough for good results
- **Character Sanitization**: Removes special characters that might cause issues

### 2. Automatic Safety Modifiers
- All prompts are automatically enhanced with safety modifiers like "safe, appropriate, and family-friendly"
- This increases the likelihood of successful generation while maintaining content quality

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- **Specific Error Messages**: Different error messages for different types of failures
- **User Guidance**: Helpful suggestions when generation fails
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Proper handling of API rate limits

## Blocked Content Types

The following content types are automatically filtered out:
- Explicit or inappropriate content
- Violence, weapons, or harmful imagery
- Hate speech or discriminatory content
- Overly vague or problematic descriptions

## Best Practices for Users

### ✅ Good Prompts
- "A peaceful mountain landscape at sunset"
- "A cute cartoon cat playing with a ball"
- "A modern office workspace with plants"
- "A colorful abstract painting with geometric shapes"
- "A cozy coffee shop interior"

### ❌ Avoid These
- Vague descriptions like "a thing" or "something"
- Potentially inappropriate content
- Requests for violence or harmful imagery
- Overly complex or contradictory descriptions

## Error Messages

### Content Policy Violation
**Message**: "The image description contains content that violates our safety guidelines. Please try a different, more appropriate description."

**Solution**: Rephrase your request to be more appropriate and family-friendly.

### Invalid Request
**Message**: "Invalid request. Please provide a clearer, more specific description of the image you want."

**Solution**: Be more specific about what you want to see in the image.

### Rate Limit
**Message**: "Rate limit exceeded. Please wait a moment and try again."

**Solution**: Wait a few moments before trying again.

## Technical Implementation

### Prompt Processing Flow
1. **Input Validation**: Check for problematic content
2. **Sanitization**: Clean and normalize the prompt
3. **Safety Enhancement**: Add appropriate modifiers
4. **Context Integration**: Safely add conversation context
5. **API Call**: Send to OpenAI with proper error handling

### Error Handling
- Specific error types are caught and handled appropriately
- User-friendly error messages are provided
- Detailed logging for debugging purposes

## API Usage

The image generation service is automatically triggered when users include keywords like:
- "generate", "create", "make", "draw", "design"
- "generate an image", "create a picture", etc.

## Cost Considerations

- Each image generation costs approximately $0.04 (DALL-E 3 standard quality)
- HD quality costs approximately $0.08
- Usage is tracked and logged for billing purposes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter persistent issues:

1. **Check your prompt**: Ensure it's clear, specific, and appropriate
2. **Try simpler descriptions**: Start with basic concepts and add detail
3. **Wait between requests**: Respect rate limits
4. **Contact support**: If issues persist, check the logs for specific error details
